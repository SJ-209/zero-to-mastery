        <h2>The Triumph T120</h2>

        <p>A current-spec T120 was purchased and delivered to OEM’s headquarters in the historic country town of Diss. 
            The chaps started the strip down, but with more care than usual: “The build brief was to keep mad modifications to a minimum,” says founder Alec Sharp. “We achieved the ‘line’ by dropping the front end and replacing the rear shocks with uprated Fox units.”</p>
            <p>The back end was sliced and diced: a new hoop was made, and machined in sections to accommodate a Z-Flex LED light strip—which includes both the rear brake lights and indicators.</p>
